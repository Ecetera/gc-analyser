        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
        <p>The motivation for this site is to provide an easy mechanism by which to analyse data from GC log files online.</p>

        <p>Sure, there's plenty of good tools out there, but none of them are in the cloud...</p>

        <p>This project is an open source effort, source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/conor10/gc-analyser">github</a></p>

        <p>All graphs have been generated using the <a href="http://dygraphs.com/" target="_blank">Dygraphs Javascript Visualization Library</a></p>

        <p>If you have any suggestions, please feel free to get in <a href="/contact" target="_blank">touch</a>
